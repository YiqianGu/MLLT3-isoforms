# MLLT3-isoforms
Generation and expansion of transplantable human hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in culture has been hampered by the difficulty of controlling  transitions between different HSC states without losing stem cell identity. Previous studies showed that MLLT3 can promote human HSC expansion in culture.  We hereby document that the function of the full length MLLT3 (MLLT3-L) is modulated by a short isoform (MLLT3-S) that is transcribed from a downstream TSS and lacks the chromatin binding YEATS domain. Unlike MLLT3-L, MLLT3-S did not promote HSC expansion. Nevertheless,  HSCs deficient for either isoform engrafted poorly in immunodeficient mice. Knockdown and overexpression studies revealed opposing effects for MLLT3 isoforms in controlling HSC regulatory programs, including HSC transcription, protein synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation and splicing. While MLLT3-L is expressed during HSC specification, MLLT3-S is induced after HSC emergence and upregulated in fetal liver HSCs, where it suppresses the pro-proliferative fetal gene IGFBP2. Together, MLLT3 isoforms create a stemness operating system that facilitates HSC transitions between expansion and maintenance modes.
